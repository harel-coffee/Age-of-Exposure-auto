# Age of Exposure 2.0: Estimating word complexity using Iterative Models of Word Embeddings
This repository contains the training and inference code for the "Age of Exposure - Word Learning using Iterative Models of Word Embeddings" paper.

Not included:
- The "Touchstone Applied Science Associates, Inc." corpus
- The "Corpus of Contemporary American English" corpus
- The Childes Child-Directed Speech corpora (https://childes.talkbank.org/)

Included:
- *train_models.py*: trains incremental Word2Vec models
- *compute_indices.py*: computes word indices used for predicting AoE scores
- *evaluate_aoa.py*: evaluates models using a set of indices
- *generate_aoe_v2_predictions.py*: trains using AoA norms and runs inference on the entire corpus vocabulary
- **run_experiment.sh**: calls all scripts in order, given a quantiles file and an experiment name
- **train_model_wv.py**: training code for Multilingual AoE 2.0

## Environment set-up
Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
And load the environment from the yml file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then you can activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate age_of_exposure_v2
```

And download other necessary resources:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```
